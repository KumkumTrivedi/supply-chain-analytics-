Supply Chain Optimization & Inventory Analysis
-> Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing supply chain operations by analyzing inventory data and sales patterns. Using a dataset of supply chain transactions, I implemented ABC Analysis and the Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule) to categorize products and identify key drivers of revenue. These insights are critical for reducing stockouts, optimizing safety stock, and improving overall logistics efficiency.

-> Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Concepts: ABC Inventory Classification, Pareto Analysis, Revenue Optimization

-> Key Analysis Performed
1. ABC Inventory Classification
I categorized products into three tiers to prioritize management efforts:

Category A: Top 20% of products contributing to ~80% of sales. (High Priority)

Category B: Next 30% of products contributing to ~15% of sales. (Medium Priority)

Category C: Final 50% of products contributing to only ~5% of sales. (Low Priority)

2. Pareto Sales Curve
Developed a cumulative sales percentage curve to visualize the concentration of revenue.

Insight: Confirmed that a small fraction of products generates the vast majority of income, suggesting a need for tighter forecasting for "Category A" items.

 ->Business Impact
Replenishment Strategy: Identified high-value items that require priority replenishment to avoid lost sales.

Cost Reduction: Highlighted low-value items where stock can be reduced to free up working capital.

Logistics Efficiency: Provided a data-driven framework to optimize warehouse space based on product velocity.
